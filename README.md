# weather-cli

A simple C# CLI application that displays weather forecasts via the OpenWeatherMap API.

I created this for myself for a quick weekend project a while back, so it only shows my local weather now, but I plan to update it to allow passing locations via args. For now, please update the code to change locations. ðŸ™‡

## Requirements

- .NET 7
- A free OpenWeatherMap API key saved to `openweathermap.apikey`
